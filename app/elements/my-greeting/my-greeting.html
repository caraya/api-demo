This is an experiment on using [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/), the [Polymer Starter Kit](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/polymer-starter-kit/index?hl=en) and a third party API (in this case Udacity's publlic API) to test the technology and how to create applications.

There are some aspects of the elements that still need refinement.

### Nested elements in JSON file

There are elements that are collections of nested children. Examples are:

* Instructors for courses
* Courses that are part of a track
* Youtube video link to embed (but see below for another issue with the videos)

### Video elements: component or no component?

In addition to being a nested element, video presents another challenge: Whether to use a component or not and if so which one to use.

The official `google-youtube` component requires a video ID to work well. The Udacity API provides a full URL for the video. Neither `google-youtube` or any other available Youtube components provide a way to use the URL and the src attribute to generate the iframe player.

I posted an issue/question to Github and was given the code below as a possible solution:

```javascript
template.toVideoIdFilter = function(youtubeUrl) {
  if (!youtubeUrl) {
    return youtubeUrl;
  }
  return youtubeUrl.replace(/https?:\/\/youtu\.be\//, '');
};
```

Other than being way above my head it makes me wonder how much will this impact performance

### Cleaning up Markdown

The Markdown provided in the JSON file is not clean. I'm trying to figure out if there are ways to clean it in the client or if I have to ping Udacity with request to clean it up.

### Search

How to best implement search functionality and how to best wire it to the app. Is a custom Google search the best way? There are no pre-made components for it so I may have to roll out my own.
